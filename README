Nyana is a small programmers text editor with a plugin system and an 
abbreviation replacement mechanism similar to Scribes <http://scribes.sf.net>. 

The overall aim of Nyana is to be similar in simplicity to Windows Notepad
but with a set of features geared to programmers. The editor is not ambitious 
and is meant to be lightweight and easily used.
